# Pass The Parcel
A simple 2D game inspired by Portal and Sokoban made using Processing (Java). This game was made for the CGRA151 (Introduction to Computer Graphics and Games) game assignment at Victoria University.

## About this game
The game begins by placing a box representing a parcel and the player will need to deliver the parcel to the delivery zone marked in yellow. The player will need to strategically place teleportational portals on the tiles marked in grey to teleport the box from one place. The portals are the key part to this game because it allows the player to get pass the obstacles (pile of crates) in order to solve the levels. The player can use the left mouse button to open a blue portal, the right mouse to open an orange portal and can also use the arrow keys to move the parcel around.

## Outcomes
From this project, I learnt how to build simple games using Java in Processing. This project taught me crucial concepts relating to software development, such as planning, testing and debugging.
